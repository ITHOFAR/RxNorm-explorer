Create views needed for FDALabel.
  NDC -> drug info

Setup rxnorm-explorer project
  Make Deno compatible version of sqljson-query.
  Backend language/framework?
    Maybe use Java but use Deno version of sqljson-query to generate sources?
    Add nix-shell entry for Deno.
  Write TS query to fetch MTHSPL product information.

-- NOTE: Use rxnsab for lists of term types (ttyl) and attributes (atnl) by data source.

SCDC semantic clinical drug component, 316047,

to improve FDA label, better aggregation functions i.e. JSON
old agg, i.e. list_agg truncate columns. new agg will have more accurate columns

Table Drug doesn't include brand name only drug, example rxcui 1550958 Aleve PM, tty BN
Maybe new table?

Look into MIN (multi ingredient)

maybe ingredient set as drug idea?

or using SCDG (very general name) then add strength to get drug or drug product

The only relationships that use rxaui are RO:included_in/includes and SY:null,

Basis of Strength Substance (BoSS)


--TODO Maybe unify SCD and SBD into drug table, move/ignore packs.

maybe rename table to SCD instead of clin_drug

--todo in readme add note to run populate-derived-schema separately

--drop non rxnorm table script
select 'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ' || table_name || ' CASCADE;'
from information_schema.tables
where table_schema = 'rxnorm'
and table_name not like 'rxn%'
and (table_name not like 'mthspl%' or table_name in ('mthspl_prod_scd' , 'mthspl_prod_sbd'))
and table_name not like '%v'
;

--trust child table for precise ingredient, not atr field precise_ingr in scdc

--In ingrset table, made choice to select PIN over IN when PIN is present in loading process

--TODO place function back in derived-schema
